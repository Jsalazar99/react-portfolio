# React Portfolio Project
This codebase contains a deployed React portfolio of my recent work samples for both front and back-end applications.

---

## Getting Started 

* This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

* To run the application:

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

To learn React, check out the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/).
